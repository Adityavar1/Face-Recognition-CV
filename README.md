# Face-Recognition-CV
I built a Face Recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and eigenfaces for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. The project involved processing and visualizing datasets of over 300 training and 80 testing images, applying reshaping, normalization, and mean centering techniques to prepare the data. I implemented visualization pipelines to display training/test samples, mean faces, and eigenfaces, and applied eigen decomposition to project images into a lower-dimensional eigenspace for recognition. This enabled effective face classification while significantly reducing computational complexity.
